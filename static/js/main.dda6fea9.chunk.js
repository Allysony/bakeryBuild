Born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1965 she had a tough childhood. Coming from a torn family, loss of her brother and a dysfunctional family, she was forced to raise herself. She put herself though school waiting tables and having multiple restaurant jobs including, bartender, prep cook, scone girl and dishwashing. Her peaceful place, where she found happiness, was in the kitchen. She met her husband in 1990 in Los Angeles where she was working as a male modeling agent, even though she was always cooking for family and friends. She was married in 1995, moved back to Sun Valley, Idaho, (where she lived from the age of 6-18), and had three boys. They decided to move Indianapolis after the passing of her Father-in-Law, and the horrible event of 911. She was in her late 40's when they started over, moving to a new city with three little boys she didn't know anyone, didn't want to make new friends and that is when she decided to bake full time. After baking out of their rental house for over eight years she knew it was time to find a place to bake, she had outgrown her tiny kitchen. She found an old house on Carrollton Avenue around the corner from where they lived. The owner the building agreed to let her turn it into a bakery. Three years later, after designing, remodeling and building, she opened her first Cake Bake Shop. She started with herself and one employee. It was a huge success from the day the doors opened. Her first shop was so busy and she had to turn customers away due to the small size of the cottage. The kitchen had 300 square feet and could only seat 30. Five years later she decided it was time to open a second location so she could accommodate more customers. Her bakery was also exploding in popularity from Oprah to Williams-Sonoma. Gwendolyn spent two years designing the second location which now seats over 150, has a 2,000 square foot production kitchen and a full service restaurant with bar. It is located in Carmel, Indiana.")),r.a.createElement("img",{src:I.a,alt:"The Bakers",width:"400",style:B.bakersimage})))},B={bakers:{position:"relative"},bakerstext:{position:"relative",width:"46%",textAlign:"left",margin:"2%",display:"inline-block",float:"left"},bakersimage:{width:"50%",display:"inline-block",float:"right"}};var L=function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"Home"},r.a.createElement(g,null),r.a.createElement(S,null),r.a.createElement(T,null))},H=t(71),V=t(76);var j=function(e){return r.a.createElement(V.a,null,r.a.createElement(V.a.Img,{variant:"top",src:e.image}),r.a.createElement(V.a.Body,null,r.a.createElement(V.a.Title,null,e.name),r.a.createElement(V.a.Text,null,e.price)))};var A=function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"Products"},r.a.createElement(g,null),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Products!"),r.a.createElement(H.a,null,r.a.createElement(j,{name:"Red Velvet",price:"$3.60",image:"./cupcake.png"}),r.a.createElement(j,{name:"Red Velvet",price:"$3.60",image:f.a}),r.a.createElement(j,{name:"Red Velvet",price:"$3.60",image:f.a})))};var F=function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"Cart"},r.a.createElement(g,null),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Cart!"))};var P=function(){return r.a.createElement(i.a,{basename:"/bakeryBuild"},r.a.createElement("div",null,r.a.createElement(s.c,null,r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"./",component:L,exact:!0}),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"./products",component:A}),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"./cart",component:F}))))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));t(66);o.a.render(r.a.createElement(r.a.StrictMode,null,r.a.createElement(P,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[52,1,2]]]);
